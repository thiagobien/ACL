# Get the Most Volatile Service

This example analyzes deployment events to create a list of services ranked by number of deployment events

For that we need

* A list of all services
* The number of deployment events per service

## Exercise
Without looking at the source code, use the API explorer to find and try out the endpoints you will need to implement this solution.

## Setting up the application

* We will use a .env file to provide the API credentials to our application. For that, copy `.env-sample` to `.env`.
* Fill in the APi credentials you created previously
* In the integrated terminal, in the project directory, run `npm install` to bring in all dependencies
* Run `npm start`
* Go to [localhost on port 3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the dashboard
