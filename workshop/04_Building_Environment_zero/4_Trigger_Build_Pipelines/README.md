# Trigger Build Pipelines

In this lab, we'll confirm that the build pipelines to populate the `dev` namespace with all artifacts completed successfully.


## Steps

1. Navigate to the *Sockshop folder* in the Jenkins home page.

1. If all builds completed successfully, you should see something like this:

1. If there are any builds that failed, you will see a storm cloud next to the name of the job:

1. Execute the pipeline for that job again in case there are any failed builds by selecting the job and then executing the `master` branch:

1. This lab concludes, once all build pipelines have been run successfully.
